## Information about me

my goal is to become a front-end developer as soon as possible, the main thing in the future is constant career and salary growth. Preferably a combined work schedule, for example, two days in the office and three remotely. From childhood, the mathematical composition of the brain and ease in learning something new, especially foreign languages. It is very difficult for me to go through days without communication.
